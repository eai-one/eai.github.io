<h1>{{ "Embodied AI" | uppercase }}</h1>



An area of artificial intelligence focused on agents that interact with the world through a physical (or simulated) body. Embodied AI goes beyond purely abstract computational tasks by integrating perception (sight, hearing, touch, etc.), action (motor control), and decision-making to learn from and adapt to changing environments.
